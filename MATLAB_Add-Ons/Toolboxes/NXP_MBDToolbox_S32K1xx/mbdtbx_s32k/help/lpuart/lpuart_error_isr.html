	<h3>LPUART Module</h3>
	<p>Selects which LPUART module to use.</p>

	<h3>ISR Level</h3>
	<p>Interrupt priority level.</p>

	<h3>Overrun Interrupt</h3>
	<p>OR is set when software fails to prevent the receive data register from overflowing with data. The OR bit is
				set immediately after the stop bit has been completely received for the dataword that overflows the buffer
				and all the other error flags (FE, NF, and PF) are prevented from setting. The data in the shift register is
				lost, but the data already in the LPUART data registers is not affected. If LBKDE is enabled and a LIN
				Break is detected, the OR field asserts if LBKDIF is not cleared before the next data character is received.</p>
	<h3>Noise Error Interrupt</h3>
	<p>The advanced sampling technique used in the receiver takes three samples in each of the received bits. If
				any of these samples disagrees with the rest of the samples within any bit time in the frame then noise is
				detected for that character. NF is set whenever the next character to be read from LPUART_DATA was
				received with noise detected within the character.</p>
	<h3>Framing Error Interrupt</h3>
	<p>FE is set whenever the next character to be read from LPUART_DATA was received with logic 0 detected
				where a stop bit was expected.</p>
	<h3>Parity Error Interrupt</h3>
	<p>PF is set whenever the next character to be read from LPUART_DATA was received when parity is
				enabled (PE = 1) and the parity bit in the received character does not agree with the expected parity
				value.</p>
