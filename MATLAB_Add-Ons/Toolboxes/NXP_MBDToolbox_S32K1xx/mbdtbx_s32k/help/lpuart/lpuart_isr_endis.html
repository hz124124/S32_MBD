	<h3>LPUART Module</h3>
	<p>Selects which LPUART module to use.</p>

	<h3>Transmit Interrupt</h3>
	<p>TDRE is set when the transmit data register (LPUART_DATA) is empty.</p>

	<h3>Transmission Complete Interrupt</h3>
	<p>TC is cleared when there is a transmission in progress or when a preamble or break character is loaded.
		TC is set when the transmit buffer is empty and no data, preamble, or break character is being
		transmitted. When TC is set, the transmit data output signal becomes idle (logic 1).</p>

	<h3>Receiver Interrupt</h3>
	<p>RAF is set when the receiver detects the beginning of a valid start bit, and RAF is cleared automatically
				when the receiver detects an idle line.</p>

	<h3>Idle Line Interrupt</h3>
	<p>IDLE is set when the LPUART receive line becomes idle for a full character time after a period of activity.
				When ILT is cleared, the receiver starts counting idle bit times after the start bit. If the receive character is
				all 1s, these bit times and the stop bits time count toward the full character time of logic high, 10 to 13 bit
				times, needed for the receiver to detect an idle line. When ILT is set, the receiver doesn't start counting
				idle bit times until after the stop bits. The stop bits and any logic high bit times at the end of the previous
				character do not count toward the full character time of logic high needed for the receiver to detect an idle
				line.</p>

	<h3>Match 1 Interrupt</h3>
	<p>MA1F is set whenever the next character to be read from LPUART_DATA matches MA1.</p>

	<h3>Match 2 Interrupt</h3>
	<p>MA2F is set whenever the next character to be read from LPUART_DATA matches MA2.</p>

	<h3>Overrun Interrupt</h3>
	<p>OR is set when software fails to prevent the receive data register from overflowing with data. The OR bit is
				set immediately after the stop bit has been completely received for the dataword that overflows the buffer
				and all the other error flags (FE, NF, and PF) are prevented from setting. The data in the shift register is
				lost, but the data already in the LPUART data registers is not affected. If LBKDE is enabled and a LIN
				Break is detected, the OR field asserts if LBKDIF is not cleared before the next data character is received.</p>

	<h3>Noise Error Interrupt</h3>
	<p>The advanced sampling technique used in the receiver takes three samples in each of the received bits. If
				any of these samples disagrees with the rest of the samples within any bit time in the frame then noise is
				detected for that character. NF is set whenever the next character to be read from LPUART_DATA was
				received with noise detected within the character.</p>
	<h3>Framing Error Interrupt</h3>
	<p>FE is set whenever the next character to be read from LPUART_DATA was received with logic 0 detected
				where a stop bit was expected.</p>

	<h3>Parity Error Interrupt</h3>
	<p>PF is set whenever the next character to be read from LPUART_DATA was received when parity is
				enabled (PE = 1) and the parity bit in the received character does not agree with the expected parity
				value.</p>
