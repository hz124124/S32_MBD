S32K11x_AMMCLIB_1.1.17
=======================
Revision 1.1.17
30-June-2019

RELEASE NOTES
=============
This is the NXP Service Release for rev 1.1.17 of the Automotive Math and Motor Control Library Set for NXP S32K11x devices, supporting the ARM M0+ core based devices.

Installation instructions:
==========================
Run S32K11x_AMMCLIB_RTM_1_1_17.exe self executable file, in order to start the installation procedure and follow the instruction on the screen. The recommended destination path (the default one) is: C:\NXP\AMMCLIB\S32K11x_AMMCLIB_1.1.17

Important notes:
================
As the Automotive Math and Motor Control Library Set for NXP S32K11x devices supports the global configuration option, it is highly recommended to copy the SWLIBS_Config.h file to your local structure and refer the configuration to this local copy. This approach will prevent the incorrect setup of default configuration option, in case multiple projects with different default configuration are used.

The Automotive Math and Motor Control Library Set for NXP S32K11x devices is delivered without pre-selected default configuration option in the SWLIBS_Config.h file. The user is responsible to set the default configuration option according the application need, otherwise the error message is displayed and the compilation of the user application did not succeed.

The bit-accurate models contain sources auto-generated by MATLAB(r). (c) 1984 - 2014 The MathWorks, Inc.
